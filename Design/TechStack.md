- Vue
  - [Vue JavaScript](https://vuejs.org/)
  - This is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework with a large community and comprehensible documentation.
    Other projects from Accutech use Vue, so building in a familiar framework for them will allow them to
    build off of the project after we have finished our work.

- .Net and C#
  - [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
  - [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
  - .Net and C# are going to be used for the back-end code. Both are popular frameworks with developers and have a number of
    sources and libraries that can be learned from. Accutech has used these for previous projects, therefore, using these
    will benefit them long after we are finished. 

- Llama
  - [Llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B)
  - A collection of pretrained generative models. This was the AI model recommended by our mentor for the use as our generative AI.

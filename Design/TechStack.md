## TechStack

- Vue
  - [Vue JavaScript](https://vuejs.org/)
  - This is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework with a large community and comprehensible documentation.
    Other projects from Accutech use Vue, so building in a familiar framework for them will allow them to
    build off of the project after we have finished our work.

- .Net and Python
  - [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
  - [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
  - .Net and Python are going to be used for the back-end code. Both are popular frameworks with developers and have a number of
    sources and libraries that can be learned from. Accutech has used these for previous projects, therefore, using these
    will benefit them long after we are finished. 

- Gemini
  - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
  - A collection of pretrained generative models. This was the AI model recommended by our client for the use as our generative AI.

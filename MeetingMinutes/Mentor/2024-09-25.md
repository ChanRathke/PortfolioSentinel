Chandler, Mason, Dennis, Edgar, Antone (Minutes Recorder), Drew (Mentor)

# Topics covered
- Merit: Seperate moneytree product, project likely will be seperate from merit.
- Document parsing: Start simple. Asset code (ex. Apple is APPL).  Will likely use seperate API
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#news-sentiment): API that drew recommends.
- Model: Will need a substantial dataset, so don't worry about making our own test model.
- [BART](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn): AI Model that Drew recommended.
- [Llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B): Another AI Model that Drew recommended.
- Front end: make front end for testing/messing with back end (admin panel).  Will be a backend heavy project.

## Model view

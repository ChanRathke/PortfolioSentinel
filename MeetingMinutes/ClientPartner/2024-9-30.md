# What was dicussed
- First iteration should focus on individual stocks, maybe mutual funds if we have time.
- Will eventually get into portfolios in later iterations.
- Good questions to ask generative AI to get good information.
- What triggers the sentinel?
- Quarterly or triggers? Potentially do both but start with quarterly for now.
- Portfolio: all the holdings combined add up to 100% of the portfolio.  Helps mitigate risk.
- Mutual Funds: Like a stock, but it's a combo deal of other stocks
- Models: portfolio but with mutual funds instead of stocks.
- Focus on the stocks sent to mason (Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Tsmc, American Airlines, etc.)
- Get the specific data about each stock and why/how changed based on earning report
- Plan on using llama since gemini and openai are paid services.

# Clarifications
- First iteration will focus on specific stocks instead of an entire portfolio
- Heavy utilization of AI tools

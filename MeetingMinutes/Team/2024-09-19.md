## Topics Discussed

We discussed how to tackle our first Iteration of the project. After a small talk with Dr. Ergin, we decided to use a Live Share in VSC to 
code the API. The API is too hard of a task to split into five different tasks. We will take turns taking the wheel in the coding of the API and 
we will ensure that everyone will be committing sections of the code. We will be hearing from the client soon about examples of some portfolios such as
quarterly statements to further our understanding of the information we will be parsing. 

## Things Clarified

After meeting with our mentor next Wednesday and doing some research into what the portfolios will look like, we will take our first steps into the API work.

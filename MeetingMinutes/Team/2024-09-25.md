## Topics Discussed

We discussed the information provided by our mentor and whether it affects our first iteration. We plan to proceed with our original plan for iteration one. However, we will now use a news article as the initial input and create a summary based on it. Our main goals for iteration one include implementing the API (potentially chaining APIs) and creating a prompt to write a summary. We briefly discussed how and when we will complete the assignments due on September 30th. We will finalize these details after our client meeting on Monday to clarify the specific inputs we will be using and how the program will be triggered.

## Things Clarified

After meeting with our mentor, we have a better understanding of how to implement the API and explored potential APIs we could use.

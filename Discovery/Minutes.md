Minute Recorder: Antone Thygerson
Meeting of Monday, 9-16-2024, at 4pm EST.
Participants: Mason, Antone, Dennis, Edgar, Chandler, Matt

Matt:  Project manager at moneytree.  Not a super technical person (ask Drew/Ergin for technical problems!).

Check with Drew about which AI model we should be using.

Meet with client at a future date to learn about how finance/portfolio tools works.

In-house tool: Merit.  creates triggers for changes in a portfolio.

Mason: What's the portfolio reference
Matt: Look up examples of quarterly statements.  Will try to send us some later today for reference.  
Look at portfolio analytics tools (merit star, factset, etc.), but not all of them.  
Not expected to be nearly as tech heavy as the other tools we'll look at.

Chandler: Is there a specific UI that you're interested in?
Matt: Utilise merit to help build a UI/frontend.

Matt: stories from teammates about clients not responding/meeting.  
Wants to set up a weekly recurring meeting (monday at 4pm) to make sure that we're following up on requirements and such.

Chandler: question about the database/tech stack.
Matt: One client / advisor setup for the database.  Email should only go to the advisor.  
Advisor might have multiple clients.

If we need anything else from matt, feel free to message him via email.

-Merit (in house tool)

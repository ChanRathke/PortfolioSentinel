## What happened?
When searching in the search bar, after typing the first letter, the search is alphabetical rather than by the first letter of the stock ticker. 

## What is supposed to happen?
When searching in the search bar, typing a letter should present stock tickers by ones that start with the letter that is searched. 

## Steps to reproduce
Simply type into the search bar with a single letter (that is not an "A") and you will likely see stocks starting with "A" that include your selected letter.
